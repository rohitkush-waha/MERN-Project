**Project Idea: Task Management Application**
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos?id=1&id=2&id=3&id=4&id=5&id=6&id=7&id=9&id=9&id=10

**Description:**
Create a task management application where users can register, log in, and manage their tasks. Users should be able to perform the following actions:

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Users can sign up and log in with email and password.
   - Implement user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for securing routes.

2. **Dashboard:**
   - After logging in, users are redirected to a dashboard.
   - The dashboard displays the user's tasks and some basic statistics, like the total number of tasks.

3. **Task Management:**
   - Users can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
   - Each task should have a title, description, due date, and status.
   - Implement pagination for the task list if there are many tasks.

4. **Task Categories:**
   - Allow users to categorize tasks (e.g., work, personal, shopping) and filter tasks by category.

5. **Search and Filtering:**
   - Users can search for tasks by keyword or filter tasks by status (completed/incomplete) and due date.

6. **Notifications:**
   - Implement a notification system that reminds users of upcoming task due dates.

7. **User Profile:**
   - Users can edit their profile, change their password, and update personal information.

8. **Database and API:**
   - Use MongoDB for storing user data and task information.
   - Create a RESTful API using Express.js to handle CRUD operations for tasks and user authentication.

9. **Frontend with React:**
   - Develop a user-friendly frontend using React to interact with the API.
   - Use libraries like React Router for routing and state management tools like Redux or React Context API.

10. **Styling:**
    - Make your application visually appealing by using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, Material-UI, or custom CSS.

11. **Security:**
    - Implement security best practices, such as input validation, preventing SQL injection, and protecting against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

12. **Testing:**
    - Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the reliability of your application.

13. **Deployment:**
    - Deploy your MERN stack application to a hosting service like Heroku, Netlify, or Vercel.

This mini project will help you gain experience in building a full-stack web application and teach you how to manage user authentication, interact with a database, and create a user-friendly interface. It's a practical way to enhance your MERN stack development skills.
